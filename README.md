  Playwright helper to locate elements relative to others

  ## Usage

  ```
  npm install --save-dev playwright-relative-selector
  ```

  Once installed, you can `require` this package in a Node.js script and use it with Playwright.

  ```js
  const relativeSelector = require('playwright-relative-selector');

  const clickMeElement = await relativeSelector(page, 'text="Sign In" toRightOf css=#home');
  await clickMeElement.click();
  ```

  ## Selectors

  Available selectors:
  - above
  - below
  - toLeftOf
  - toRightOf
  - near

  An element is considered relative to another if the distance between the two is of 30px or less.

  ## Examples

  ### First example

  This code snippet sets a page with three buttons and clicks on the 'Click me' element on the right of 'Middle'

  ```js
  const { firefox } = require('playwright');
  const relativeSelector = require('playwright-relative-selector');

  (async () => {
    const browser = await firefox.launch({ headless: false });
    const context = await browser.newContext();
    const page = await context.newPage();
    await page.setContent(`
      <div>
        <button>Click me</button><span>Middle</span><button>Click me</button>
      </div>
    `);

    const clickMeElement = await relativeSelector(page, 'text="Click me" toRightOf text="Middle"');
    await clickMeElement.click();

    await browser.close();
  })();
  ```
