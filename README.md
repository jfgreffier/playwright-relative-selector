const clickMeElement = await relativeSelector(page, 'text="Sign In" toRightOf css=#home');
await clickMeElement.click();
```

## Selectors

```js
const { firefox, selectors } = require('playwright');
const relativeSelector = require('playwright-relative-selector');

(async () => {
  const browser = await firefox.launch({ headless: false });
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();
  await page.setContent(`
    <div>
      <button>Click me</button><span>Middle</span><button>Click me</button>
    </div>
  `);

  const clickMeElement = await relativeSelector(page, 'text="Click me" toRightOf text="Middle"');
  await clickMeElement.click();

  await browser.close();
})();
```
