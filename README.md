Playwright helper to locate elements relative to others

## Usage

```
npm install --save-dev playwright-relative-selector
```

Once installed, you can `require` this package in a Node.js script and register relative selectors.

```js
const { chromium, selectors } = require("playwright");
const relativeSelector = require('playwright-relative-selector');
// Register relative selectors
await relativeSelector(selectors);

const browser = await chromium.launch(opts);
const page = await browser.newPage();

await page.click('text="Sign In" >> toRightOf css=button');
```

## Selectors

Available selectors:
- above
- below
- toLeftOf
- toRightOf
- near

An element is considered relative to another if the distance between the two is of 30px or less.

## Examples

### First example

This code snippet sets a page with three buttons and clicks on the 'Click me' element on the right of 'Middle'

```js

const { chromium, selectors } = require("playwright");
const relativeSelector = require('playwright-relative-selector');

await relativeSelector(selectors);

await page.click('text="Sign In" >> toRightOf css=button');

(async () => {
  const browser = await firefox.launch({ headless: false });
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();

  await page.setContent(`
    <div>
      <button>Click me</button><span>Middle</span><button>Click me</button>
    </div>
  `);

  await page.click('text="Click me" >> toRightOf text="Middle"');

  await browser.close();
})();
```
